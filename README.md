# MESA Models for HD 20794

This repository contains the input files (`inlist.py`) and supporting scripts used to compute stellar evolution models of the metal-poor G-type dwarf HD 20794 using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA).

The models were constructed to reproduce the observed stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, radius, and age) and to track the evolution of surface and central abundances using an extended nuclear reaction network that includes phosphorus (P) and chlorine (Cl) isotopes.

## Contents
- `inlist.py`  
  Python-based MESA inlist generator used to produce the full model grid.
- `LOGS/`  
  Example output directories generated by MESA.
- `analysis/` *(optional, if you add later)*  
  Post-processing and plotting scripts.
  - `inlist_network`  
  Nuclear reaction network configuration, including the extended PCl network available at Medhi et al. (2023).

## Scientific Context
These models are described in detail in:

> *Revisiting the Stellar Structure and Elemental Abundances of HD 20794*  
> (submitted to MNRAS)

The repository is intended to ensure reproducibility of the stellar
evolution calculations and to provide a transparent reference for the
adopted physical assumptions, numerical controls, and boundary conditions.

## Requirements
- MESA (version r24.08.1, build 13.3.0, SDK version x86_64-linux-24.7.1)
- Python ≥ 3.9
- `mesa_reader`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
